To check what is different from the latest commit:
	$ git diff <name of the file>

To go back to the latest commit 
	$ git checkout .

Note: it will only work over changes on files that have been commited before, if you create new files and make changes in those, it won't work.

If we want to go to a previous commit, not jus the latest:
	-> $ git log : to check the commit.
	-> copy the id of the commit
	-> $ git checkout <id of commit> -- <path to the file>
