Intro to git and the most common commands

	- In root of the project.
	- Will create the directory as a hidden file.
	$ git init

	- Sends elements from the local directory to the git directory

	- Commits the changes added to the git repository. Kind of like making a snapshot of the project.

Github introduction

Github is not git. It is a library for git repositories. 
Quick info:

	-> The name of the github repo doesn't have to be the same as the local one.
	
	-> Once the git repo is made and we made a commit, we can push it into the remote repo (that's basically github, a remote repository)
	
	-> We can have several remote repositories for different purposes. But we should create an origin one.
		$ git remote origin <link to github repo>
		$ git push origin master
	
	-> Interacting with the remote
		$ git push // Sends stuff into the remote repo
		$ git fetch // Takes stuff from the remote repo
	
	-> Selectin which remote to send the data:
		$ git push -u <name of remote> <name of the branch>
